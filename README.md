# HCI-Project
A website created using HTML5 and CSS3 for Spain tourism.

An interactive website needs to be designed to provide an inflight cultural experience for tourists flying to Spain. This will be a tourism website for Spain that would contain information like attractive destinations, activities to do, art and culture tips, travel advisories, sport, shopping recommendation, accommodation facilities, native Spanish language translator, weather predictions, state map and much more. This will be a complete guide for tourists travelling to Spain with all the information they need.
Both passengers and flight-attendants are expected to be using the website. Passengers are using the website for the first time and are expected to navigate around the website by themselves. The flight attendants are expected to be experienced over the usage of the website so that they can help the passengers with queries, if any. The tourism company is expected to provide the content for the website and keep the information updated as required.
